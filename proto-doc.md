# Part 1

I let my users demo my app via their mobile browsers or their desktop because the app
is still a prototype and it allows me to make updates in nearly real-time.

demo is [here](http://vivekmumbles.github.io/slates/slates).

Feedback:

- better FPS, do not render if you do not need to
- better combining animation and hovering animation
- ability to chain moves
- add swipe
- add sound effects
- add undo option
- add social networking ability
- add instructions GIF
- they liked the colors
- create better levels
- allow for user to create custom levels
- add logo

# Part 2

- added an undo option, but not the functionality
- changed level configurations
- created the option for users to create their own levels

I didn't do the rest because I suck really bad at CSS and ran out of time.

# Part 3

They liked the new levels and the ability to create their own custom levels
