# Part 1

I let my users demo my app via their mobile browsers or their desktop because the app
is still a prototype and it allows me to make updates in nearly real-time.

Feedback:

- better FPS, do not render if you do not need to
- better combining animation and hovering animation
- ability to chain moves
- add swipe
- add sound effects
- add undo option
- add social networking ability
- add instructions GIF
- they liked the colors
